# MEMS Breakout PCBs

This repo contains KiCad projects for PCBs designed to break out MEMS devices for research/development.

## MEMS Breakout W50

This PCB is contained in the `mems_breakout_w50/` directory and provides 50 connections from wire bond pads on the MEMS die that are routed to standard pitch (2.54mm) headers.
